                <p class="p-top-margin">SpacePod is a podcasting app that has been specifically created to foster a community around podcast listeners and producers. Prior to SpacePod, the podcasting community was the only major creative community that did not bridge the gap between creator and consumer. SpacePod allows for users to create custom playlists with their favorite episodes, send audio messages to channels, leave timestamped comments, and even start their own podcast. SpacePod weaves high user personalization, a sleek, easily navigable interface, and diverse community interaction methods together to allow users to find the content that matters most and engage with the content and community more thoroughly than ever before.</p>

Secondly, I wanted to know how users found content that was more suited to their needs when viewing trending items. After testing I discovered that users prefered to see trending episodes on the discover page rather than channels, as episodes felt more approachable and easier to dip into rather than a whole channel.</p>

            <p class="p-top-margin">After creating creating my mockups, I was then able to conduct usability tests. Throughout the course of these tests, I was able to understand the user's needs that still needed to be addressed within my podcasting app. Users were largely able to complete all of the tasks set forth for them in the tests, however they sometimes felt confused due to a lack of labeling. Additionally, some suggestions were made about the visual design to help aleviate tension within the designs. I took the feedback and synthesized the data to find the following crucial points that needed addressing:</p>

                  <ol>
                    <li class="sp-color"><p>Following Apple H.I.G. guidelines and user feedback, I decided to delay sign-up for new users as long as possible, in order to decrease abandonment rates and allowed potential users to fall in love with the app before making a commitment to it. This meant that the app needed a new blank state that would hint at what this screen might look like once users signed up.</li>
                    <li class="sp-color"><p>I soon learned that a new blank state was needed once user's logged in. One that felt more anchored and directed users toward their next step.</li>
                    <li class="sp-color"><p>Early on in my testing, it became very apparent that all of my icons needed to be labeled in order to help orient the user, eliminating guesswork, and allow for seamless navigation throughout the app.</li>

                    <li class="sp-color"><p>I filled in buttons to create stronger hierarchy. I also updated the green color to one that allowed for better readability.</li>
                    <li class="sp-color"><p>Throughout testing, it became increasingly apparent that I needed to address the areas of large text. To make these sections more legible, and to reduce eye strain, I increased the font size and spacing. I also added a light green color to some of the text, so that they eye would pick up subtle variations of color, which would make distinguishing between sections easier.</li>
                    <li class="sp-color"><p>Once again, I learned of the importance of labeling. Users knew what some of the tab bar icon meant, but frequently steered clear of those that seemed unfamiliar. This resulted in labeling all icons in the tab bar and on the play screen to better orient the users.</li>
                    <li class="sp-color"><p>After feedback, I also decreased the size of the play button so users did not feel as if it was "shouting at them."</li>

                <p class="boxed-title preference-marg">For the play screen preference tests, I purposely removed the skip buttons with the intention of having them be accessible via touch actions on the album artwork itself. If I decide to implement touch features in the feature, it became very clear that there needs to be clearer labeling or even a mini onboarding session that educated users on where these features would be.</p>

            <h2 class="studio-h-two text-margin">Branding</h2>
            <p class="p-top-margin">When thinking about logos and names for this product, I wanted something that was distinct and and stood apart from the myriad of other podcasting apps. I knew the name and logo should convey a particular mood and experience. The subsequent name—SpacePod—and logo are the best choices because they do just that. They evoke a sense of playfulness and exploration. The design moves away from the trite broadcast symbols used by myriads of other app (Apple podcasts, Overstock, Pocket Casts) and serves as a breath of fresh air. The bright color scheme also inspires freshness and interaction that set SpacePod apart from the predominantly white themed podcasting apps.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="second-paragraph">After receiving feedback on my initial logo sketches, I iterated on the idea of an alien for an icon and combined it with headphones (another separate idea I had had). After multiple rounds of sketching, I decided to go with a standard and more recognizable alien icon than the one I originally presented. Making this switch garnered instant recognition for and familiarization with the icon.</p>
            <p class="second-paragraph">When choosing fonts, it was important that the title font reflect the same sense of fun and playfulness that the icon did, which is why I chose Chango as the title font. However, I knew that body text would need to be clear and easy to read at various sizes, so I went with a friendly yet legible typeface called Hind.</p>

              <p class="underline p-top-margin">Clarity = icons + labels</p>
              <p class="second-paragraph">No matter how much you may assume that users will know what your icons mean, it’s always best practice to label them. Labeling icons significantly reduces user strain and fatigue, especially when introducing new features. During usability testing, I found that users often shied away unfamiliar icons rather than explore them. Making sure that users feel orientended will encourage them to explore the new features.</p>
              <p class="underline text-margin">Knowing when to use dark theme</p>
              <p class="second-paragraph">Let’s face it dark theme is cool. It’s sleek and incredibly appealing. However, as I was considering the visual design of SpacePod, I had to make sure that I was using a dark theme because it made sense for my app, not just because it looks flashy. When thinking through my designs, I knew that users would primarily focus on podcast album artwork. The app include small doses of text, but nothing long enough that would cause eye strain reading on a dark screen. Furthermore, the dark colors allowed the users to focus on the most important information.</p>
              <p class="underline text-margin">Stay focused on the MVP</p>
              <p class="second-paragraph">Creating a space where both podcast listeners and creators could interact was a fun challenge. However there were times that I found myself wanting to add features for my smallest demographic (podcast creators) when I didn’t know enough about their specific needs and concerns--I’m looking at you, channel monetization. While this seems like a no brainer feature that would encourage more creators to use this app, I did not have the data to backup this feature at this time. It’s something I recommend investigating for future iterations, but it was not part of the original MVP.</p>
