            <h2>TL;DR:</h2>
            <p class="about-margins">I am an execution and results-oriented designer, who backs her creative design decisions with data. Each step of my journey--from studying poetry in college to working at a nonprofit museum to enrolling in Bloc’s UX apprenticeship program--has provided me with crucial skills vital to my success as a user experience designer. While research, rapid iteration, and usability testing are some of my core strengths, I frequently find myself participating in a variety of cross-disciplinary activities like user and stakeholder interviews, visual design, digital marketing, and data analysis.</p>
            <p>For a deeper look into each leg of my journey, please continue reading below. Each stage had its “golden nuggets” that ultimately led me to become a UX designer.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="poetry">
            <h2>What my English degree (and poetry) taught me about user experience design.</h2>
            <ol class="about-ol">
              <li><span class="bold">Empathy is everything.</span>
                <p class="about-margins">In poetry, empathy is necessary to create a compelling moment or story arc. As a writer, if you want your poem to be understood you need to understand your audience--how they interpret stanzas and digest a poem’s overall meaning. The same is true in UX design. A good designer doesn’t just build things. Rather, they seek to understand. In design, it’s important to know where users get frustrated and where they are succeeding. It is only then that our work is successful.</p>
              </li>
              <li><span class="bold">Revision and iteration keep what’s working and strengthen what isn’t.</span>
                <p class="about-margins">This quote, by writer William Faulkner, serves as a reminder that sometimes the ideas, words, etc. we cherish the most must be removed in order to create cohesion between the work and the reader. This idea holds true in the design field as well. How often have designers been tempted to keep an icon even though users don’t comprehend it? How often have we favored one layout even though preference testing suggests a different user favorite? I know I’ve been there. But with a keen understanding that we must sometimes “kill our darlings,” it is easier to let these personal preferences give way to those elements which will promote clarity and greater understanding.</p>
              </li>
              <li><span class="bold">“Kill all your darlings.”</span>
                <p class="about-margins">In poetry, the author almost never creates a perfect piece on their first draft. In college, I participated in weekly revision workshops with other writers to gain and give feedback. It was here where I learned that constructive criticism leads to tweaking which in turn leads to increased clarity. In UX, iteration is essential to the design process. I have learned how to iterate under time constraints, and how to let personal opinion give way to fact.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="nonprofit">
            <h2>What working at a non-profit museum taught me about user experience design.</h2>
            <ol class="about-ol">
              <li><span class="bold">Know your audience and do your research.</span>
                <p class="about-margins">While working on fundraising campaigns and managing the museum’s CRM database, I learned the importance of research-backed decision making. With an abundance of donor information just a few keystrokes away, I frequently advocated for more personalized interactions with our members. Segmenting members by giving level, past events attended, preferred contact method, etc. yielded much better fundraising results as well as increased positive donor outreach with staff members.</p>
              </li>
              <li><span class="bold">Listen to your users.</span>
                <p class="about-margins">Stewarding members was one of my essential duties while at the museum. I would reach out to new members who just joined. Call up lapsed members to ask why they didn’t renew. Field questions from individuals having difficulty on our website. Each interaction allowed me to collect data on our members’ experiences and in turn enabled me to propose new ways to meet their needs. When the museum was designing a new website, I played a crucial role in advocating for a stronger site hierarchy and seamless navigation.</p>

          <div class="bloc">
            <h2>What Bloc’s apprenticeship program taught me about UX Design.</h2>
            <ol class="about-ol">
              <li><span class="bold">Coding.</span>
                <p class="about-margins">Learning to code has been a new and challenging experience. While adding HTML, CSS, and Javascript to my toolbelt, I have gained a greater understanding of the designer/developer hand-off process and what it takes for a smooth transition.</p>
              </li>
              <li><span class="bold">Refinement of visual design skills.</span>
                <p class="about-margins">I’ve always had a natural leaning toward creativity, but Bloc’s apprenticeship program allowed me to fine-tune many creatively focused skills. The program allowed me to dive deeper into typographic best practices, color theory, space, and hierarchy. These, in turn, had a profound impact on my work and consequently, on my users’ experiences.</p>
              </li>
              <li><span class="bold">Timeboxing a project.</span>
                <p class="about-margins">Being enrolled in a rigorous program has taught me the essential skill of managing myself, my expectations, and my time. I have learned how to iterate quickly, to fail fast and fail often. I have learned that efficiency and thoroughness can go hand-in-hand and that sometimes you need to move quickly through a project.</p>

              <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
              <p>As a UX Designer with a creative background and a growing love for hard data, I strive to craft ideas that answer a question or fix a frustration. My aim is to sculpt engaging experiences with a high level of quality and detail. I’m always looking for new insights and opportunities that will benefit both me and my surrounding community.</p>
