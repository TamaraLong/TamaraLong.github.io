      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>STUDIO is cloud storage web application focused on promoting and supporting creativity within the design community. The product provides storage space for users’ work and projects, the ability to share and collaborate with others, as well as a new project layout that provides more fluidity than a regular single page word document, to help inspire and encourage a more intuitive and visual virtual workspace for all design processes.</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>I was tasked by a client to reach untapped audiences within the realm of the cloud storage marketplace. The goal was to design a niche product that allowed users to save web content, organize and create content, and upload files, while also considering additional features such as sharing functionality and real time collaboration on documents.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>STUDIO is a cloud storage app specifically created for designers and creators.  User research found that the biggest existing frustrations for creators were price and storage limitations, followed by file quality limitations and the lack of version control. STUDIO addresses all of these issues, while also performing the essential functions of cloud storage including uploading, organizing, and sharing and collaborating on files. STUDIO’s design evolved overtime, sporting a new creative workspace called Project Boards, through multiple iterations based on usability testing as well as feedback from senior designers.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>User Surveys</h2>
        <p>To understand how I arrived at my solution, we must start at the beginning — namely, conducting user research. By creating and distributing a user survey, my goal was to find out what users most wanted from a cloud storage platform. The results from the survey would inform the following:</p>
        <ul class="insights">
          <p> Who are the people using cloud storage? </p>
          <p>Are users paying for their cloud storage? </p>
          <p>What are the most important features? </p>
          <p>What are their top frustrations?</p>
        </ul>
        <div class="survey_results">
          <p class="title">Key Insights</p>
          <div class="result_one">
            <p class="percentage">93%</p>
            <p>want the ability to share their work with others.</p>

          <div class="result_two">
            <p class="percentage">80%</p>
            <p>currently use free cloud storge platforms or the free accounts options.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="result_three">
            <p class="percentage">80%</p>
            <p>of users are involved with design work as either a career or hobby.</p>

          <div class="result_four">
            <p class="percentage">73%</p>

          <div class="result_five">

          <h2>User Personas</h2>
          <p>After analyzing the data, it was clear that the target audience for the newly proposed cloud storage product would be designers and creators. From there, I was able to breakdown the userbase into two additional categories: hobbiests (or those just starting out) and professionals.</p>
          <p>Using data from my survey, I was then able to create tasks for each of the personas, as well as identify points of user frustration.</p>

        <h2>User Stories & Flows</h2>
        <p>Taking the insights from the user survey as well as the newly created user personas, I created user stories to determine the types of tasks indivudals would be looking to complete while using this new product. I then converted the stories into user flows to show how the user can accomplish primary tasks, like the one shown below.</p>

          <h2>Sketches & Low-Fidelity Wirefames</h2>
          <p>Next it was time to bring each user flow to life. I began with a pen and paper and sketched multiple versions of each flow, highlighting different potential layouts. My goal was to produce several quick iterations, that I could then parse through for the best pieces.</p>
          <p>Following my sketches, I then created my early rounds of digital wireframes using Figma. For initial inspiration and reference, I looked at the screens for other cloud storage sites like Dropbox, Google Drive, and Mega, to ensure that my designs felt intuitive and easy to navigate, rather than something foreign and complex.</p>

          <h2>Usability testing the wireframes</h2>
          <p>I conducted both in-person and remote usability tests on my completed lo-fidelity wireframes. It was during this testing period that I learned that my site navigation needed to be better defined and some functionality aspects needed some tweaking. I then implemented these findings when creating my hi-fidelity mockups.</p>

          <p class="title">Key Insights</p>
          <p class="underline">Test one element at a time.</p>
          <p>I unknowingly tested two separate background colors for the Projects Board layout. While there still was a majority vote for one of the choices, I now recognize that testing more than one element at a time yields inconsistent and unreliable results, because you don’t know which element users are responding to.</p>
          <p class="underline">Continuity is key.</p>
          <p>Users want consitent designs throughout their products. While layouts for different pages don’t have to be identical, users want to be able to see that they are still within the same product as they navigate through the different pages.</p>
          <p class="underline">Listen to what the users say they want, then watch how they perform with their given choice.</p>
          <p>This was an especially interesting insight for me. When I was preference testing the Project Board layout users stated one thing (that they wanted a skinny tool pannel), but said another when actually navigating the product in a round of usability testing. New users didn’t always know what certain icons meant and wanted longer explanatory/labeling text. This in turn made the icon pannel much bigger than users in the preference test wanted. However, this is when I decided to create an expandable icon pannel. Newbies could expand the panel to read what each icon was, but more seasoned users could collapse the pannel so it didn’t take up as much of their work space. </p>

        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <p>Next it was time to bring each user flow to life. I began with a pen and paper and sketched multiple versions of each flow, highlighting different potential layouts. My goal was to produce several quick iterations, that I could then parse through for the best pieces.</p>
        <p>Following my sketches, I then created my early rounds of digital wireframes using Figma. For initial inspiration and reference, I looked at the screens for other cloud storage sites like Dropbox, Google Drive, and Mega, to ensure that my designs felt intuitive and easy to navigate, rather than something foreign and complex.</p>

          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <p class="underline">Familiar icons = happy users</p>
          <p>During the scope of this project, I learned just how important it is it follow design conventions and use icons that users are familiar with. Users loved the idea of Project Boards and linking external media, but none of them knew how to go about the process. This was a great opportunity for me to learn that if a feature is new, then the process of accessing that feature needs to be as familiar and as intuitive as possible to ensure that users actually utilize it.</p>
          <p class="underline">MVPs and scope creep</p>
          <p>I also learned a lot about managing scope creep during this process. The project brief included a lot of potential features that didn’t actually end up in the final product. Had I focused in too soon after receiving the project brief, I would have been creating a product that was too big for the scope — not to mention, one that would be under utilized by users. This was a good reminder to wait on research and results before acting.</p>
